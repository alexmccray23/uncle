====== DP Macros ======

There are DOS macros Kayna wrote to make the set up of DP a lot easier.  The macros are saved in K:\practice\dosmacro

Below is the list of the Macros used to set up the E-file and a description of what they do:

===== To run these macros, type ALT+letter: =====
  * **ALT+A** - Adds what's in the block to the end of the line
